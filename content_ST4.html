                <h3>Facet #1 - Food Security</h3> 
                <p>This facet focuses on ensuring that all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. The UN works on strategies to enhance food production, distribution, and access, especially in regions affected by conflict, poverty, and environmental degradation.</p>

            <div class = "home_text_for_images_right">
                <h3>Facet #2 - Sustainable Agriculture</h3> 
                <p>The UN promotes sustainable agricultural practices that prioritize environmental conservation, biodiversity, and resilience to climate change while increasing agricultural productivity. This includes support for small-scale farmers, investment in agricultural infrastructure, research and development of resilient crop varieties, and the promotion of agroecological approaches.</p>

            <div class = "home_text_for_images_left">
                <h3>Facet #3 - Nutrition and Health</h3> 
                <p>Addressing hunger also involves tackling malnutrition in all its forms, including undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, and overnutrition (such as obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases). The UN emphasizes nutrition education, supplementation programs, maternal and child health services, and initiatives to improve access to diverse and nutritious foods.</p>

            <div class = "home_text_for_images_right">
                <h3>Facet #4 - Poverty Alleviation and Economic Development:</h3> 
                <p>Hunger is closely linked to poverty, inequality, and lack of economic opportunities. The UN advocates for policies and programs that promote inclusive economic growth, livelihood diversification, social protection, and access to education and healthcare. Empowering marginalized communities, especially women and youth, is central to ending hunger sustainably.</p>

                <h3>Facet #5 - Humanitarian Assistance and Conflict Resolution</h3> 
                <p>In regions affected by conflict, natural disasters, and other emergencies, the UN provides humanitarian assistance to ensure immediate access to food, clean water, and essential services for affected populations. Additionally, the UN works to address the root causes of conflicts and promote peacebuilding efforts to create stable environments conducive to long-term food security and development.</p>
